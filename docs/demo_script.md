## Hook (30 seconds)
*"What if you could own your mental health data and earn from it while helping others?"*

**PsyChat** is the first privacy-first mental health platform on Polkadot that:
- 🔒 Encrypts your therapy notes with XX Network quantum-resistant E2E encryption
- 🎫 Mints them as soulbound HNFTs (Human NFTs) on Polkadot
- 🏪 Lists anonymized insights on a Polkadot DEX-powered marketplace
- 💰 Auto-compounds earnings into DeFi yields via Polkadot payments

*"Built by MotusDAO for Polkadot Sub0 - let's see it in action."*

## Call to Action

*"PsyChat is more than a hackathon project - it's a blueprint for the future of mental health on Web3. Built with love by the MotusDAO community, powered by Polkadot's ecosystem."*

**GitHub:** [github.com/motusdao/psychat](https://github.com/motusdao/psychat)  
**Demo:** [psychat.app](https://psychat.app)  
**Built for:** Polkadot Sub zero   

*"Thank you to the Polkadot ecosystem: XX Network, Arkiv, and the Polkadot community. Together, we're building the cypherpunk future of mental health."*

## Backup Talking Points

### If Technical Issues
- "The beauty of PsyChat is in its simplicity - encrypted chat, tokenized data, DeFi yields"
- "Even if we hit a snag, the vision is clear: own your mental health data, earn from it"

### If Time Runs Short
- "Core value prop: privacy-first mental health data ownership with sustainable earnings"
- "Polkadot ecosystem integrations show interoperability and technical execution"

### Judge Questions
- **Q: How do you ensure data privacy?**
- **A:** XX Network quantum-resistant E2E encryption encrypts data before storage on Arkiv blockchain. Messages are triple-redundant (Arkiv + XX Network + localStorage) and only anonymized aggregates are shared.

- **Q: What's the business model?**
- **A:** Users earn from anonymized data sales via Polkadot DEX, platform takes small fee, sustainable UBI through DeFi yields on Polkadot.

- **Q: How does this scale?**
- **A:** Polkadot's interoperability + Arkiv's efficient storage + XX Network's decentralized encryption + mobile-first design = scalable to 1M+ users.

- **Q: How is identity recovered?**
- **A:** XX Network identity is derived from Polkadot wallet signature, so same wallet = same encryption keys. Identity stored in Arkiv for recovery.
