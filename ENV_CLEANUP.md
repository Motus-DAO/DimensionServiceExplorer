# Environment Variables Cleanup

The following Solana-related environment variables should be removed from `.env.local` or your environment configuration:

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SOLANA_NETWORK`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SOLANA_RPC`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_PSYCHAT_PROGRAM_ID`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_PSYCHAT_IDL_PATH`
- Any Arcium-related environment variables

These are no longer needed after migrating to Polkadot.
